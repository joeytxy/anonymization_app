    model_explanation.markdown('''While it is possible to use the entity text identified as PERSON by the packages directly, character index was used in this implementation to provide users with an union/intersection option. Using character index ensures that the union/intersection function is applied on the same word.

Suppose we have this sentence: <font color='blue'>**"Kim went to her office today. She had a meeting with Mr Kim."** </font>

Package A tags "Kim" as PERSON. However, there is a possibility that A recognises the first "Kim" as a PERSON and not the second occurence. Let us assume that that is the case.

**Package A: <font color='red'>Kim</font> went to her office today. She had a meeting with Mr Kim**.

Suppose we have another package B that tags both "Kim" as PERSON.

**Package B: <font color='red'>Kim</font> went to her office today. She had a meeting with Mr <font color='red'>Kim</font>**.

Without the use of character index to determine, the intersection of both packages would have given the following output:

**'<font color='red'>[Name]</font> went to her office today. She had a meeting with Mr <font color='red'>[Name]</font>.'**

While this is a correct output, it does not fit the definition of intersection.

By using character index, we can recognise that A recognises character index 0 to 3 as a person name, and not character index 56 to 59. The intersection betweeen [0,1,2,3] and [0,1,2,3,35,57,58,59] would have given [0,1,2,3]. Masking the word at sentence[0:3] would have given us:

**'<font color='red'>[Name]</font> went to her office today. She had a meeting with Mr Kim.'**

which fits our definition of intersection.

Word index was not used as different packages may tokenise the sentence differently, resulting in the same word having a different index.''',unsafe_allow_html=True)
